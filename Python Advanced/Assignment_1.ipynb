    "There are four pillars of Oops:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Encapsulation - It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Inheritance - Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from an added class. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    It represents real-world relationships well.\n",
    "It provides the reusability of a code. We do not have to write the same code again and again. It allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.\n",
    "It is transitive, which means that if class B inherits from added class A, all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Polymorphism - The word polymorphism means having many forms. In programming, polymorphism means the same function name (different signatures) being use for different types.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. Abstraction - Abstraction is used to hide the internal functionality of the function from the users. The users only interact with the basic implementation of the function; inner working is hidden. User is familiar with that “what function does” they do not know “how it does.”"
